# Quiz-app
It is a Quiz app in which you can have  basic quiz and get highscores.

What I learned from the Project:-
  In this project I learned many things such as DOM Manipulation,targeting specific elements through different methods,map function,for each loop,pushing elements to array,storing /retriveing data into/from localStorage,usage of functions,ES6 syntax,debugging,chromeDevTools,loading dynamic data by the use of Javascript,using CSS effectively and many more things.

About the Project:-
  This basic homePage start with two blocks in which you can select whether to Attempt the Quiz or to check the highscores.Once you click on the homepage you will be directed to the quiz questions.As you will answer the questions it will turn red/green respectively with the answer you made.There is also a progress bar from which you can see about how much of my questions are completed. You will get the marks according to the correctly attempted questions and so the highscore will be updated.This all is done using pure JavaScript,HTML,CSS.

  I just started a 100 days of project with JavaScript in which i will try and make different websites for testing my coding skills and learning new things. Firstly i am trying to creating the some apps in javascript and then i will swith to reactjs.
It was a great fun making the project
